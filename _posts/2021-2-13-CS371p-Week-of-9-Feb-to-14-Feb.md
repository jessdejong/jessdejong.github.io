# What did you do this past week?

On Monday, I submitted the Collatz project, after making sure that my entire Collatz repository had everything the rupric required. I also attended the lectures for this class, and learned a lot of new information about C++. 

# What's in your way?

Currently, there isn't anything that is in my way for this class. I have a lot of work for other classes this weekend and the beginning of this coming week, so most of my time will be spent on those assignments.

# What will you do next week?

I have yet to be called on by Professor Downing to answer some questions in class, so maybe I'll be called up this coming week! I also plan on working on other classes next week, because I have a bunch of assignments due soon. Over winter break, I tried to get into competitive programming, but I stopped when school started. I really want to make solving some CP problems a habit, so maybe I'll start that this week.

# If you read it, what did you think of the Pair Programming?

I thought the Pair Programming article was really useful, because it made it really clear how effective pair programming can be. I think it is true that pair programming helps to avoid bugs and other errors in your code, and help both programmers understand everything that's going on. However, I feel like pair programming is useful in certain situations more than others. If you take two experienced programmers who are familiar with the codebase and make them pair program, they'll probably make less errors together. However, I think it be more effective if the two coded separately on different tasks, especially if both tasks are manageable for each of them. During my past internships, I never really saw any pair programming. I think that if developers are trying to create something new in code, pair programming is much more effective.

# What was your experience of operators, pointers, and references? (this question will vary, week to week)

I was familiar with the basics of operators, pointers, and references, mainly because I have a little experience with C and C++, but it was nice to see Downing explain the logic behind these parts of the C++ language. Downing's way of teaching C++ involves getting us to really understand how the language works, and helping us to learn every detail, which is really nice. I think a lot of people (myself included) can get by programming in a certain language, but not understand the little details of that language, which are really important to understand your code.

# What made you happy this week?

I really enjoyed my AI project this week. My partner and I finished up the project on Tuesday, which mainly involved writing search algorithms and creating heuristics. I especially enjoyed the project because it required thinking more deeply when it came to writing the code. Another thing that made me happy was the fact that project was in Python -- I last programmed in Python when I was like 10 years old, and it was nice to get reaquainted with the language after all of these years.

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick of the week is this really cool article about Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat: 

[The Friendship That Made Google Huge](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)

Jeff Dean gave a really cool talk about the future of AI here at UT last semester, and I found this article after looking him up. Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat were two of the original google employees, and together they helped to create groundbreaking software and systems within Google, including MapReduce, TensorFlow, and Spanner. Within Google, they were famous for what they accomplished as a pair (they pair programmed).
