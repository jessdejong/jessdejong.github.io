# What did you do this past week?

During this past week, I worked on two projects, one for this class and another for my Artificial Intelligence class. Most of my progress on both projects have been this weekend. Yesterday, I did the Collatz project, but I still need to make sure that I follwed the rubric and have all of the necessary files in my fork. My AI project involves implementing search algorithms to create a pacman AI agent, which has been pretty fun so far. The project is partnered, and I'm enjoying it -- looking forward to working with a partner (hopefully) in the OOP projects coming up!

# What's in your way?

For the Collatz project, I need to make sure that I pass all of the acceptance tests found on the public test repository. I tested my code with all of these tests before, and noticed that I failed 2, so I'll look into that before I submit. Other than that, I have a lot other projects and homeworks due early this next week, so I'll need to get on top of those. Hopefully I'll start tonight.

# What will you do next week?

Next week, I'll make sure to complete the homeworks in Algorithms and AI. I'll also catch up on lectures/discussions that I missed in other classes. My AI class requires me to read a lot from the textbook each week, and I've usually been putting aside the reading for the weekends. The coming week, I'll try and start the reading early (wednesday, maybe). For this class, I plan on spending an hour on Monday making sure that my Collatz fork is ready to be submitted, and then I'll submit.

# If you read it, what did you think of the Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration seems like a really useful tool, and seems to be a widely adopted process by most companies. In projects where you work with a bunch of other developers, having a system to keep each developer on the same page is really important. For the Collatz project, however, I found CI to be a bit less useful, mainly because I worked by myself. In the future, if I work with a partner, I'm sure the CI will be very useful to make sure we are both in sync. 

# What was your experience of Collatz? (this question will vary, week to week)

Collatz wasn't too bad. I thought that I would have to spend a good amount of time looking through the files that were already provided in the repository, and trying to make sense of everything. In the end, however, just reading the makefile helped me to pretty quickly understand what was going on. The makefile proved to be really useful! I was able to implement a lazy cache without too much debugging, which was nice. I ran into some problems with using doxygen, but looking on piazza helped me a lot.

# What was your experience of exceptions? (this question will vary, week to week)

Exceptions seem really useful, but I've always had some mixed feelings on them. Before, I thought that using a try-catch block seemed like a bad coding practice. My thought process used to question why would you try to catch an error, rather than just avoid that error in the first place! Lecture taught me that exceptions are really useful, especially for debugging your code for errors and being able to handle things that go wrong.

# What made you happy this week?

I enjoyed watching the ATP Cup (Tennis), and seeing Russia beat Italy in the finals. I'm also looking forward to watching the Australian Open! My favorite player is Djokovic, and I really want him to win.

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

When I was in high school, I competed in an AI competition called Halite ([Halite competition](https://2016.halite.io/)). This past week, because I'm taking an AI class here at UT, I checked it out again. It was really really fun when I competed in the 2016 competition, even though I didn't do so good. The idea of writing a bot to "compete" against other bots is really cool!
