# What did you do this past week?

For this class, I've been working on the Voting project with my partner. So far, our program can correctly read input and write output, and solve the first Hackerrank test case. We also wrote a couple test cases. I'm pretty happy with the progress we've made so far!

# What's in your way?

My partner and I are timing out on the last two Hackerrank test cases. We haven't added any optimizations yet to our basic solution, so that's what we'll be doing next week.

# What will you do next week?

Next week, my partner and I will be adding optimizations to our Voting code so that we pass the last two test cases on Hackerrank. I also have a couple of tests coming up next week, so I'll spend a good chunk of time preparing for those tests.

# If you read it, what did you think of the Single Responsibility Principle?

I really enjoyed the article on the single responsibility principle, and I felt that a lot of the ideas and reasoning in the article rang true. A couple of months ago I read [this article](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2011/07/why-i-dont-use-autocomplete.html#:~:text=The%20Law%20of%20Demeter,-The%20Law%20of&text=That%20means%20that%20if%20your,return%20value%20of%20the%20object.), which introduced the concept of the Law of Demeter and SRP to me. Slightly unrelated, but the article eventually argues that using auto-complete makes it easier for programmers to violate the SRP principle, and therefore autocomplete might be more of a crutch than a tool.


# What was your experience of Voting and consts?

At first glance, I thought that the Voting project would be slightly more straightforward than the Collatz project. However, I now know that's not the case! Already, my partner and I have written about twice the amount of code that I wrote to solve the Collatz problem, even without optimizations. 

The const keyword is something that I would frequently use in C++, but never questioned the different use cases of the keyword. For me, it was one of those things to just plug-and-chug in my code (not recommended) to make a variable constant. Today, I learned that the const keyword is much more complicated. One particular use case that was new to me was const applied to pointers, which helped me understand both the const keyword and pointers in C++. 

# How did you fare in the storm?

My apartment fared pretty well! I only lost water for a day, so I was grateful for that. I spent the first couple of days (before everything turned to ice) playing in the snow, and had a lot of fun! I even got to sled down some hills on campus. Despite all this, I was really glad/relieved when the cold finally cleared up and was happy to have some really nice sunny weather for a couple days.

# What made you happy this week?

My favorite tennis player won the Australian Open!

# What's your pick-of-the-week?

The article I linked earlier, [Why I Don't Use Autocomplete](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2011/07/why-i-dont-use-autocomplete.html#:~:text=The%20Law%20of%20Demeter,-The%20Law%20of&text=That%20means%20that%20if%20your,return%20value%20of%20the%20object.). The author compared autocomplete to Google Instant Search, a feature that is useful in some cases, but often distracting from the goal of converting your thoughts into text. This made a lot of sense to me, so I disabled Google Instant Search. I also don't use autocomplete, but that's mainly because I use vim and I'm lazy.
