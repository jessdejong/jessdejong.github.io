I'm Jesse, and I'm in my second year at UT Austin. This is me:

# Where did you grow up?

I grew up in a relatively large (~100,000 people) suburb of Dallas, named Richardson.
Richardson's claim to fame would probably be the University of Texas at Dallas, which is a couple minutes from my house. That's where my dad teaches, and why my family lives in Richardson.

# Why are you majoring in CS?

I went to Richardson High School, which happened to have a really strong computer science program, and a very passionate CS teacher.
Each year, I had the opportunity to take a different computer science course, and learn something new in the field. Outside of my classes, I competed in competitive programming competitions, hackathons, and capture-the-flags (a security competition). I also met some of my best friends along the way! CS has always interested me, while also providing a fun and active community, which is why I chose to major in CS in college. Side note: I'm also majoring in math.

# How much C++ do you already know?

I took Operating Systems with Gheith, and I occasionally solve competitive programming problems in C++. I'm not too familiar with the language.

# How did you feel about the cold calling?

Cold calling is perfect for online classes. It helps me pay attention in class, and actively engage in the lecture. I also think that cold calling helps to foster a sense of community, which might otherwise be non-existant (because we're online). Getting the correct answer is encouraged, but not required, which relieves some stress and pressure.

# What's your pick-of-the-week?

A movie called "Midnight in Paris", starring Owen Wilson. Main takeaway from the movie: what we WANT in life is right in front of us. Second takeaway: Paris is awesome.

# What's your tip-of-the-week?

I recently picked up a bullet-journal, and I've been using it to organize my to-dos, my schedule, my classes, and keep up with my New Year's Resolutions. Hopefully I'll stick it out for at least a year! So far it's been fun and productive hobby. Would recommend!
