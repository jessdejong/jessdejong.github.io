# What did you do this past week?

My partner Samantha and I finished up the Voting project for this class, and submitted it earlier this week. I've also been busy studying and taking tests in my Algorithms and Numerical Analysis classes.

# What's in your way?

For this class, not much is in my way. I missed class this past Friday, so I'll have to watch that lecture sometime soon. I also have to catch up on some other lectures for other classes as well, but I think that's pretty much it. I had two tests this past week, so I'm looking forward to some relatively calmer weeks going forward, at least before Spring Break.

# What will you do next week?

Next week, I'll catch up on lecture, and make sure to organize my schedule to prepare for any projects that I have in this class or my AI class.

# If you read it, what did you think of the Open-Closed Principle?

The Open-Closed Principle article was really interesting, and I learned a lot about writing maintainable, well-designed code. I probably should have payed more attention to the actual code snippets provided in the article, because I feel that the best way to learn about a good programming practice is to see the practice implemented in code. I think that a lot of these practices may come with years of experience working on larger systems.

# What was your experience of arrays, iterators, and algorithms?

I took OS with Gheith last semester, and gained some experience working with arrays in C++. I would occassionally use pointer arithmetic to navigate through arrays, but I never worried about any specific details like the ones discussed in class. My experience with iterators and algorithms in C++ is mainly from solving the occasional competitive programming problem. Usually, I find myself needing to iterate through the contents of an unordered_set in C++, which is why I'll use an iterator. I've used the stl::algorithms library occassionally to permute a vector or do binary search.

# What made you happy this week?

My roommate won an Oculus Quest at a hackathon recently, and this week I got to try it out. I had a lot of fun messing around in the tutorial provided by Oculus, and was amazed by how impressive the experience was. I danced with a robot, shot a gun at a target, and watched a YouTube 360 video documenting a large valley. I had tried an Oculus VR headset back in high school, and it's clear that the technology has come a long ways since then. 

# What's your pick-of-the-week?

I found a collection of articles written by Edsger Dijkstra, a Computer Scientist who was a Professor at UT Austin before passing away. I found [this article](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html) particularly interesting. It describes the growth of the Computer Science/Software Development field over the last half-century, and how Dijkstra helped to define the discipline of programming.
