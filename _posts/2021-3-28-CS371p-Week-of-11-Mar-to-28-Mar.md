# What did you do this past week?

I procastinated on EVERYTHING during spring break, so I spent a lot of time catching up. I had a test in AI this past Thursday, and I spent a good chunk of time just preparing for that. For this class, I finished up and submitted the Allocator assignment on Monday, as well as attended most of the lectures for this week. Unfortunately, I continued to push off watching the lectures for most of my classes.

# What's in your way?

Need to watch lectures, study for my algorithms exam that's coming up this next week, and catch up on other homework. There's a lot of things that I plan to start working on for the second half of this semester, but before that can happen I have to start being more efficient with my time.

# What will you do next week?

Next week, I'll study for my algorithms exam, as well as catch up on lectures and homework. For this class, I might begin looking into when the next project is due, and scope out when my partner and I want to get the project done. I might be heading back to my home (from austin) for a couple days of this week.

# If you read it, what did you think of the Interface Segregation Principle?

The article was really interesting, and it was nice that the author provided a bunch of clear examples to help me wrap my head around the concept. I found the examples of how "fat" interfaces cause problems to be particularly helpful for my understanding.

# What was your experience of initializations, and vector?

I've used the STL vector in the past, and I'm pretty familiar with defining my own constructors in class, but I learned a lot this week about the specific benefits of using the vector class as well as the initalizer_list.

# What made you happy this week?

I had a really good time celebrating a friend's birthday this weekend. I also had a lot of fun working on a reinforcement learning project for my AI class with my roommate. We got to teach an AI agent to crawl!

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

A really cool [algorithm visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/) that a friend made back in high school. It might be helpful if you have an algo test this week!
