# What did you do this past week?

This past week, I worked on the Allocator project. I ended up working by myself, which I was initially worried about because I thought that I might run into difficult bugs that would be really tedious and tough to fix without a partner, but luckily everything went smoothly. I've solved the Hackerrank test cases, but I still need to work on finishing up the project.

# What's in your way?

This past week I've missed a couple of quizzes at the beginning of lectures, as well as forgetting to actually submit my blogpost URL on canvas (again), so I definitely need to get on top of all of those things. For the allocator project, I have to clean up my code, write some acceptance and unit tests, create the necessary documentation and meet the submission criteria, and submit. For other classes, I need to catch up on lectures.

# What will you do next week?

Next week is Spring Break, so I'm looking forward to having some fun with friends I haven't seen in a while, as well as take advantage of my free time to try and pursue things that interest me. For my classes, I'll be finishing up the Allocator project, as well as finishing up the third project for my Aritificial Intelligence class with my partner. I would also like to start Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera, and get into competitive programming over this Spring break. I'll also play some tennis with my sister.

# If you read it, what did you think of the Liskov Substitution Principle?

The article was interesting, and made a lot of sense given the Open-Closed principle that we learned about from last week's article. The principle made a lot of intuitive sense, knowing that inheritance and polymorphism state that a child class of a parent class inherits everything from the parent, and knowing that if you don't follow the principle you end up with a lot of unecessary 'if' statements. 

# What was your experience of heap arrays, allocators, and digits iterator?

OS with Gheith last semester introduced me to heap arrays and the concept of allocating and deallocating memory in detail, but I was not familiar with the concept of an allocator object. I've use iterators in the past, but never dived into how they worked too deeply.

# What made you happy this week?

I was happy to go home and see my dad! It'll be nice to have a week off from school.

# What's your pick-of-the-week?

Two interesting podcasts given by Lex Fridman. [The first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTxRF5ag27A&ab_channel=LexFridman) was an interview with Bjorne Stroustrup, the creator of C++. [The second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghwaIiE3Nd8&ab_channel=LexFridman) was an interview with Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.
