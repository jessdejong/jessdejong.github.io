I'm Jesse, and I'm in my second year at UT Austin.

# Where did you grow up?

I grew up in a relatively large (~100,000 people) suburb of Dallas, named Richardson.
If it weren't for the University of Texas at Dallas, which is located a couple minutes from my house, you'd probably never hear of Richardson.
My dad teaches at UTD, so that's how my family ended up living there!

# Why are you majoring in CS?

I went to Richardson High School, which happened to have a really strong computer science program, and a very passionate cs teacher.
With my friends, I competed in competitive programming competitions, hackathons, and capture-the-flags (a security competition).




I began by taking AP CS my freshman year, and 

I went to Richardson High School. My favorite things about my HS was 
1) it was really diverse! demographically and personality-wise.
2) very passionate cs teacher, and strong comp-sci program.

# What high school did you attend?

Richardson High School. This was a great

# Why are you majoring in CS?

It's pretty difficult for me to answer this question. I've been programming/doing cs for so long, I've forgotten my primary and original motivation.
I enjoy problem solving, but sometimes my brain can't handle that shiiii.

# How much C++ do you already know?

I took Operating Systems with Gheith, and I occasionally solve competitive programming problems in C++. I'm not too familiar with the language.

# How did you feel about the cold calling?

Cold calling is perfect for online classes. It helps me pay attention in class, as well as foster a sense of community, which I appreciate.
I also don't find the cold calling particularly intimidating, because Downing isn't too harsh if you answer incorrectly.

# What's your tip-of-the-week?

I recently picked up a bullet-journal, and I've been using it to organize my to-dos, my schedule, and my classes. 10/10 would recommend.
