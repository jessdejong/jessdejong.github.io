# What did you do this past week?

This past week I began working on the Darwin project with my partner. So far, we've manaaged to read in input, set up the basics of each class, and plan out how we're going to approach the rest of the project. I've also attended most of the lectures for this week and read the most recent paper. I'm happy to have finished up my tests for my other classes.

# What's in your way?

My partner and I ran into some segmentation fault errors while working on the Darwin project. We associated them with memory errors, and for now we think we've managed to get rid of most (or all) of them. I have a feeling that they might end up showing up again and causing more issues. I need to catch up on lectures for this class, so I'll do that.

# What will you do next week?

For this class, catch up on lectures and continue working on the Darwin project. I also need to figure out housing for this summer and next year, so I'll try to get on top of that. I also want to find a new organizational system for my time, because my time management recently has been pretty bad.

# If you read it, what did you think of the Dependency Inversion Principle?

I thought the principle was interesting, and insightful. Developing code that is useful, maintainable, and reusable is really important and the basis of good software design, so the principle is really important.

# What was your experience of vector, copy constructor, and copy assignment?

I like the fact that c++ gives you the ability to modify the operators on an object/class. In OS with Gheith, I learned that this was possible, but from the recent lectures I learned more about the copy constructor and copy assignment. I learned that vector's constructor this week is declared explicit.

# What made you happy this week?

I went hiking with a friend yesterday, and I had a lot of fun even though everything was muddy. We got to see a mini waterfall.

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

[Open AI's GPT-3](https://analyticsindiamag.com/open-ai-gpt-3-code-generator-app-building/). The article has some videos of the AI generating html code from descriptions of a web page in natural language. I thought it was super cool. The GPT-3 AI is a neural network built off of the internet's data.
