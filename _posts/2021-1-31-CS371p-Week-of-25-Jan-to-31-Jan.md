# What did you do this past week?

I attended lecture, did the assigned reading, and I'm about to finish up this week's blog post. I've found lecture this week particularly interesting, mainly because Professor Downing has been lecturing about a variety of software development tools. Most of my professors don't acknowledge this aspect of computer science, but I'm always interested in what academia considers to be the "best practices" in industry.

# What's in your way?

Mainly, just getting over the initial hurdle of setting up and simply beginning work on the Collatz project. The project, and its setup, have a lot of components to keep track of and understand, and I'll likely need to set aside an hour just to make sure that everything about the project is relatively organized in my mind.

# What will you do next week?

I will install and set up docker on my laptop, and get started on the Collatz project. I also have a couple of other projects due either soon or next week (for other classes), so going forward I'll need to manage my time a bit better.

# If you read it, what did you think of the makefile?


I'm not too familiar with makefiles, so I learned a good amount from this week's reading. I find most makefiles pretty intimidating to look at, but the Makefile for the Collatz project was a bit more manageable. I learned about how makefiles are structured, and the main components of makefiles, which helped me gain a better idea of what's going on when you run 'make' on your project.

# What was your experience of Docker?

This will be my first time using Docker, but I'm excited to get it up and running! I can see how it is a really useful tool for development, mainly because I always manage to mess up the packages on my computer, and find it impossible to sort out.

# What was your experience of assertions?

I used a fair amount of assertions in my operating systems class. Assertions were particularly useful when I tried to debug code that was running on multiple cores.

# What was your experience of unit tests?

My most recent internship required me to write unit tests for all the code that I wrote. I was coding in Java, and used jUnit for my unit tests. This was pretty straightfoward, at first. Eventually I had to write some more complex tests, which required an entirely different thought-process than writing normal code. I found mocks particularly counter-intuitive.

# What made you happy this week?

I enjoyed diving a bit deeper into the details of C++. It was nice to be able to compare C++ syntax to Java syntax, which I'm a little more familiar with. I'm looking forward to more lectures like this in the future!

# What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick-of-the-week is an awesome Google 20% project: [Trump2Cash](https://github.com/maxbbraun/trump2cash).
Here is the corresponding Medium article: [This Machine Turns Trump Tweets into Planned Parenthood Donations](https://onezero.medium.com/this-machine-turns-trump-tweets-into-planned-parenthood-donations-4ece8301e722).

It's a stock market bot that buys and sells stocks based on public companies mentioned in Trump tweets. The idea behind Google 20% time is that Google developers get to spend 20% of their time working on side projects. I think the policy is no longer being continued, but it's a really interesting practice to get developers to create new potential products, and increase their creativity!
